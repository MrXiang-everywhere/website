    intro:
      'I am a self-driven PhD student in the field of solid mechanics and soft matter science. I have accomplished my M.Sc. degree at the University of Alberta in the group of Prof. Tian Tang focusing on the asymmetric adhesion harnessing structured interface. I am currently pursuing my PhD degree at McGill University in the group of Prof. Jianyu Li focusing on the development of mechanically instructive material for wound dressing.',
